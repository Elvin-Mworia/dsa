Books which i used to learn and implement the data structures include:
1.Grokking Algorithms An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people (Aditya Bhargava)
2.Problem Solving in Data Structures  Algorithms Using Python Programming Interview Guide (Hemant Jain) 
3.Python Data Structures and Algorithms (Benjamin Baka)
